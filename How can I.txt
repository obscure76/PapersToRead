6 Important Points from a Googler's Perspective.
Before I provide you the list of courses, read Point 1, 2.
Full-time working professionals—Read this answer "selectively" on the basis of your industry experience and academic knowledge.
Pre-University Students—Skip everything and Jump to Point 7.

# Point 1: Lets Get to the actual Question i.e.

How can I prepare myself to be a "good" software engineer?

Yep! Rest of the question is optional. Joining Google is not a moonshot. Any Good software Engineer has Good chances to be part of Google work-culture.
Problem is how you define "Good".
** Point 2: Attitude Adjustment.

Before you impress recruiters at Google, Lets see if a software engineering role at Google is something you actually want.

Software engineering is not as fun as the popular notion says about it. Apart from UI/UX positions, in general, no matter what text editor you use—Eclipse, Vim or Emacs—Your screen will be Black, Boring & Dull. A full-time software engineering role not only requires an ability to work on complex algorithms but enough tolerance and patience to focus on meticulous details of a large program.

At Google, in general, most software engineering role comes down to nothing but mathematics. It doesn't matter how many languages you know or how cool you are with Java, C, C++ etc.

What matters are these four objectives:
Your ability to create efficient algorithm.
Your meticulous skills to read codes written by others and spot issues in it, if any.
Your curiosity to learn and implement new technology trends and adapt with demand.
Last but most important: What you Build, how you Build?

I must point out that attaining these four objectives is not easy. Most of us at Google have hard time reaching these objectives but we try, so should you.

Everyone has different approach towards learning. For me, I read one research paper links I find on Quora(May/May not be related to CS) and one research papers at Google(Internal records)—everyday.

When you join Google, you will have access to all code base, database, forums, research papers and projects which will provide you a great support in learning things which you won't find on Wikipedia...

...but while you are preparing on your way to be at Google, there are few things which are common in the process of learning. In point #5, you will learn more about it—how to reach these four objectives—but before there're some pre-requisites that needs to be looked upon. So, Lets go to next step. i.e.
# Point 3: Guide for Technical Development in 2014—From Google.

Having a solid foundation in Computer Science is important in being a successful Software Engineer. Following guide from Google is a suggested path for University students to develop their technical skills academically and non-academically through self paced hands-on learning. You may use the following course guide to determine courses to take but please make sure you are taking courses required for your major or faculty in order to graduate. The online resources provided in this guide are not meant to replace courses available at your University. However, they may help supplement your learning or provide an introduction to the topic.
Using this guide:

# Point 6: Google Recommended/Sponsored Programs and Groups.

Few Additional Course you may choose to subscribe with respect to your domain or interest. These courses and programs are a great place to learn but they don't increase or decrease your chances to join Google—They are not equivalent to Internship. (More Info from Robert Love)

** Point 7: Recommendation for Courses in Mathematics.
(For Pre-University Students)

Personal View: Any attempt to ignore these subjects will put you in the category of average programmers who learn things in completely wrong way.

Staying prepared much before would make coding much more enjoying. There are few pre-requisites, for software-engineering, which you need to understand the core of algorithm. Most mistakes created by software engineers could have been avoided if they would've recalled the simple things from school education.

In your further studies in Maths or Computer Science, You will realize the importance of "Data Structure in your college days" and importance of "Machine Learning in your post-graduate days". So, Following are detailed list of courses you must master in-order to design complex algorithms. For college-graduates, if you had ignored these subject, I highly recommend you should revise it in the best possible way you can.

After you're done with introductory syllabus from your school books, practice the following courses for deeper understanding. Most college students (even working professionals) underestimate the importance of these courses and end up being just another average programmers:

Linear Algebra
1. Linear Algebra | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare (Recommended by Me)
2. Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Application (Recommended by a coworker)

Learning these will help you understand Regression Model in future—The basic step of Machine Learning. You won't be taught these linear algebra courses in any school, colleges, research labs or institution. Learn it on your own.

Calculus
1. Calculus 1 - Ohio State University
2. Pre-Calculus Courses - Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona
3. Calculus for Beginners and Artists - MIT

Statistics & Probability
1. Statistics One
2. RNG, Advanced Placement — stattrek.com

Note: By the time you reach college and graduate, the syllabus would've moved towards Machine Learning algorithms. To most college students, mathematics gives them a pretty hard time for first 3 months of Machine Learning courses and by the time they catch up, syllabus moves to more sophisticated areas of ML, such as Deep Learning, Neural Networks & NNSP.

​One does not simply walk into the Googleplex. The company receives upwards of 2.5 million job applications a year, but only hires about 4,000 people.

For would-be Googlers, the Google in Education team has released a list of skills that they want to see in potential engineers through self-paced, hands-on learning.

Google wants its tech talent to master the below skills, complete with online resources to get you started...

#1. Learn To Code

Learn to code in at least one object-oriented programming language, like C++, Java, or Python. Consult MIT or Udacity.

Coding is taking an algorithm & implementing it out. Even a 10-year-old can follow the instructions to code, but that won’t make that code extensible and scalable.

#2. Test your code

It’s not just important to know how to code. You should also be able to test code, because Google wants you to be able to 'catch bugs, create tests, and break your software.'

#3. Have some background in abstract math

It is important to have some background in abstract math, like logical reasoning and discrete math, which lots of computer science draws on.

#4. Get to know operating systems

Get to know operating systems, for they'll be where you do much of your work.

#5. Become familiar with artificial intelligence

Become familiar with artificial intelligence. Google loves robots.

#6. Understand algorithms and data structures

Learn about fundamental data types like stacks, queues and bags as well as grasp sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort and heapsort.

#7. Learn cryptography

Learn cryptography. Remember, cybersecurity is crucial.

#8. Learn how to build compilers

Stanford says that when you do that, 'you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines.'

#9. Learn other programming languages

Add Java Script, CSS, Ruby and HTML to your skillset. W3school and CodeAcademy are there to help.

#10. Learn parallel programming

Also, learn parallel programming because being able to carry out tons of computations at the same time is powerful.
------------------------------------------------

Outside of your curriculum and outside of what your professor has asked you to do, do one thing on your own in this Computer Science space, because if you’re willing to join Google for a career, you’ve got to be excited about this space.

For example, if you’re a computer science student, do a side project, a computer science project on your own, one open source contribution on your own. Not the typical bug fixes.

Here are the skills Google wants its tech talent to master, complete with online resources to get you started:
1. Mastering the foundation. You have to be able to get through an introduction to CS course, like the ones from Udacity or Coursera.
2. Learn to code in at least one object-oriented programming language.Like C++, Java, or Python. Consult MIT or Udacity.
3. Learn other programming languages. Add Java Script, CSS, Ruby, and HTML to your skillset. W3school and CodeAcademy are there to help.
4. Test your code. Because Google wants you to be able to "catch bugs, create tests, and break your software." Udacity, once again.
5. Have some background in abstract math. Like logical reasoning and discrete math, which lots of computer science draws on. MIT can help you with mathematics for computer science.
6. Understand algorithms and data structures. Google wants you to learn about fundamental data types like stacks, queues, and bags, as well as grasp sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort. MIT provides the recommended online resources, and the book "The Algorithm Design Manual" is super helpful, too.
7. Get to know operating systems. Because they'll be where you do much of your work. The University of California, Berkeley, provides a primer.
8. Become familiar with artificial intelligence. Google loves robots. Stanford has the knowledge.
9. Learn how to build compilers. Stanford says that when you do that, "you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines." Head to Coursera for the learning.
10. Learn cryptography. Because cybersecurity is crucial. Coursera andUdacity provide courses.
11. Learn parallel programming. Because being able to carry out tons of computations at the same time is super powerful. The University of Illinois can help you out.
But Google doesn't just look at skills in its select candidates

In all honesty, I mean no offense to Google when I say this, but why limit yourself like that? Google is a great place to work but what would the world be like if Sergey and Larry would have asked "How do I get a job at Microsoft?"

There are two ways :

Either you need to have a really really impressive background with strong(I mean really strong...like blazing fast ) coding ability , should be flawless in algorithmic knowledge and Maths . [ Because Luck doesn't favor all , believe me , you might be good in stuffs but if you don't click within that 45 mins , noone cares who you are or what you are !! ]
Or, you have worked / are working on an app which has / about to have more than a million users , then you won't even require interviews , Tech Giants other than Google would love to have you in their Team !

P.S. Be an Over-achiever and you would be in a position to turn down Google !

1. Practice as much as you can.
2. Learn some important algorithms. Try "Introduction to Algorithms" book. Or take up the "Algorithmic Thinking" course at Coursera.
3. Take part in contests so that you know where you stand. Try HackerRank.
4. Keep an eye on Google based projects such as GSoC and Code Jam.

P.S. Google is not the only great company for programmers. Keep your mind open just as much as you should keep your eyes open. All the best!

There are an estimated 5k candidates with similar profile like you in India. 

Recently a guide was revealed by Google Education to make it more clear about the domains of expertise that Google prefers.

Google in Education

With a decent experience, abilities to crack their written tests and a perfect resume to match the applied profile, you are one decent, eligible candidate for their job.

PS - I wonder why you want to work only with Google and not create your own startup after so much experience. Do something so that Google searches for you rather than you searching for Google.
Timely team at Bitspin was one such example.
